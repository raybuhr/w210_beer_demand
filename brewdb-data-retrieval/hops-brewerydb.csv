The flavor has citrus and floral notes, and something like a Cascade character, but with more bitterness.

The original was selected from the field of a farmer named Musgrave Hilton who had a farm in the English town of Bramling. Bramling was once one of the most popular aroma hops in England, but gradually faded as higher-yielding varieties became available. Until recently, it was still grown in small amounts in England and in British Columbia, Canada, where it may be one of the cultivars sold as British Columbia Golding. Bramling also lent its name to one of its progeny, the rare but still available Bramling Cross cultivar.",1,,31,36,36,

Used as a general-purpose bittering hop, lately this easy-growing hop has been used to provide a unique fruity, blackcurrant and lemon notes in traditional ales, especially in Christmas ales and cask-conditioned ales.

Unlike modern bittering hops, Bullion has a strong, distinctive character which is perceptible, especially in additions later than 60 minutes. The aroma and flavor characteristics are strong, pungent and sometimes harsh or resiny, with elements of spiciness and a fruit character that has been described as black currant or raspberry. Bullion has become less popular with the wide availability of new bittering hops with better storage characteristics and a more neutral bittering character, but its unique flavor makes it worth considering for home and craft brewers.",1,,12,65,45,
